## About The Project

"Foldgame" is a simple web implementation of the pre-existing game concept of:

1. writing down some answer to a question
2. passing around the sheet of paper
3. repeat 1+2 until the series of questions end
4. Disclose the random stories to the group

While sometimes the results are just weird nonsense, often times they can be
the cause of amusement.
